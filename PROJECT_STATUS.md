   - **Downloaded:** Models cached by HuggingFace (~5GB)
   - **Time Taken:** ~5 minutes
   - **Fixed Issues:**
     - Updated to Stable Diffusion 2.1 (runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 deprecated)
     - Configured HuggingFace authentication token
     - Installed PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support for RTX 4070

2. **Train DreamBooth Model for Butcher** ✅ IN PROGRESS (50% Complete)
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_dreambooth.py --config training/config/butcher_config.yaml
   # Resume from checkpoint:
   python scripts/train_dreambooth.py --config training/config/butcher_config.yaml --resume
   ```
   - **Status:** Training in progress on RTX 4070
   - **Progress:** Step 400/800 (50%), loss=0.0195 (down from 2.39)
   - **Settings:** 800 steps, FP16 mixed precision, resolution 512x512
   - **Estimated Time:** ~1.5 hours remaining (~13.4 seconds per step)
   - **Output:** Custom Butcher model at `models/dreambooth_butcher/`
   - **Checkpoints:** Saved at steps 100, 200, 300, 400 (automatic every 100 steps)
   - **Validation:** Images generated at each checkpoint successfully
   - **Fixed Issues:**
     - Resolved device placement errors (text_encoder not on GPU)

## Known Issues

### Current Errors

None - all previous blockers resolved!

### Resolved Issues (October 7, 2025)

**DreamBooth Training Issues:**
1. ✅ **HuggingFace Authentication Error (401 Unauthorized)**
   - **Cause:** Invalid or missing HuggingFace token
   - **Fix:** Created new read token, added to `config/.env` as `HF_TOKEN`

2. ✅ **Base Model Deprecated**
   - **Cause:** `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` no longer maintained by Runway
   - **Fix:** Updated to `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1`

3. ✅ **PyTorch/Diffusers Compatibility**
   - **Cause:** `diffusers 0.35.1` incompatible with `transformers 4.57.0`
   - **Fix:** Downgraded to `diffusers==0.30.3` and `transformers==4.44.2`

4. ✅ **CUDA Not Available**
   - **Cause:** PyTorch installed without CUDA support
   - **Fix:** Reinstalled PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 for RTX 4070 GPU support

5. ✅ **Device Placement Error (CPU/GPU mismatch)**
   - **Cause:** Text encoder not moved to GPU when `train_text_encoder=false`
   - **Fix:** Explicitly moved text_encoder to accelerator.device after prepare()
   - **Error:** "Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cpu and cuda:0"
